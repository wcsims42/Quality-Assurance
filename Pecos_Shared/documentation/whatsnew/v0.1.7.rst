v0.1.7 (June 2, 2018)
------------------------

* Added quality control test to identify outliers.
* Bug fix to allow for sub-second data frequency.
* Dropped 'System Name' from the analysis and test results, this added assumptions about column names 
  in the code.
* Changed 'Start Date' and 'End Date' to 'Start Time' and 'End Time' in the test results.
* New data added to a PerformanceMonitoring object using add_dataframe now overrides 
  existing data if there are shared indexes and columns.

  column names is generated when data is added to the PerformanceMonitoring object 
  using add_dataframe.
* Added Python 3.6 tests.
* Removed Python 3.4 tests (Pandas dropped support for Python 3.4 with version 0.21.0).
* Updates to check_range requires Pandas 0.23.0.
